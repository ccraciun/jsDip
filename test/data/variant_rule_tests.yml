# 7. COLONIAL VARIANT

# The rulebook of the second print of the colonial variant is used as source for these test case. Note that the regular rules in the Colonial rulebook are not based on the 1982 rules as you might expect, but on the 1971 rules.

# The errata published by Avalon Hill is used as additional source (The General, Volume 30, Number 4). The exact text of this errata is as follows:

# Errata published by Avalon Hill

# Map Addition: Kyoto is starting Colony for Japan. There should be a white circled dot in Kyoto.

# Map Change: Constantinople is a province of Turkey. It should be printed in the same white colour as the rest of Turkey.

# The correct abbreviation for the Andaman Sea is "AND.S" as per Rule 13.0; the abbreviation found on the conference map is incorrect.

# Rule Change: 9.11: Delete "China may not enter Hong Kong until

# the turn after another power has occupied it at the end of a counting move (even-numbered turns)."

# 9.34: Delete "A EGY S SUD"

# 9.35: Change "Turkey A EGY S British F RS-MED" to "Turkey F EGY S British F RS-MED"

# Clarifications: TRANS-SIBERIAN RAILROAD

# 9.21 Only the Russian player may use the TSR. The Russian player may not allow another power to use it.

# 9.23 This rule restricts the attack capability of units using the TSR

# A unit using the TSR may attack:
# (1) a province that is unoccupied at the start of the turn. Normal rules of conflict would apply,
# (2) a province that is occupied at the start of the turn but was made empty during the current turn as a result of that unit moving out. Normal rules of conflict would apply, or
# (3) a province that is occupied at the start of the turn, but if the unit remains in place then the attack will be unsuccessful (even with support) and the unit will have to stop in the nearest empty province along the line of the railroad before the enemy-occupied province (e.g. An army in Moscow with orders A MOS-TSR-VLA with an enemy unit holding in Vladivostok results in the Moscow army stopping in Irkutsk --the order is legal, in the hope that the province will be vacated, but unsuccessful).

# Note: So long as an enemy unit remains in place it may not be successfully attacked that turn by a unit using the TSR. This still applies even if that enemy unit is attacked by a third power that turn and forced to retreat, for example: Russia A MOS-TSR-VLA China A VLA HOLD Japan A SEO-VLA, F OS S A SEO-VLA

# The Russian unit stops in Irkutsk. The Chinese unit retreats (not to Irkutsk or Seoul). The Japanese unit from Seoul takes Vladivostok.

# 9.241 The presence of a foreign power in a province along the line of the TSR blocks its use beyond that point. However, if the unit later moves off this province thus unblocking the line, the TSR may again function normally, that is, control of the province reverts to Russia (it is assumed the partisans rebuild the line).

# EXCEPTION: If a supply center on the line of the TSR (Moscow, Omsk, Vladivostok) is captured by an enemy power and later vacated, ownership remains with that power and the TSR is out at that point until Russia is able to recapture the province. Only then is the line "open" again. For example, if China owns Omsk but has vacated it, a Russian unit using the TSR from Vladivostok could move to Omsk, but no further that turn.

# 9.25 A curious example of this rule applies if an enemy unit attacks from one province to another along the line of the TSR at the same time that a Russian unit is railed through these provinces in the same direction such as:

# Russia A VLA-TSR-OMSK China A KRA-OMSK

# This results in a standoff in Omsk. The Chinese unit stays in Krasnoyarsk and the Russian unit stays in Irkutsk. The logic being that Krasnoyarsk is left empty by the Chinese at the time the Russian unit moves through. Thus both units attack Omsk and cause a standoff. NOTE: The above result would also have occurred if the Russian unit had been ordered to Perm or Moscow because the same standoff would still occur in Omsk.

# SUGGESTED ADDITION TO MAP The island of Sakhalin is contained entirely within the Okhotsk Sea and a unit there cannot be eliminated, so it is suggested that a - land bridge - arrow should connect Otaru and Sakhalin thus allowing a supported attack from Otaru and Okhotsk Sea to take Sakhalin.

# CEBU Cebu is one space containing both land and sea. It can be occupied by either an army or a fleet. An army can use the - land bridges - to move from Manila to Cebu and Cebu to Davao (and vice versa). The game spaces adjacent to Cebu are: Manila, Middle Pacific, Lower Pacific, Davao, Sulu Sea and Luzon Strait.

# Trans-Siberian Railroad

# Q. In the following situation, where do A Mos and A Omsk end up? Russian orders: A Mos-TSR-Vla, A Omsk-Kra, A Vla-Seo; Chinese orders: A Mac-Irk.
# A. The standoff in Kra means that A Omsk does not move and A Mos stops in Perm.

# Q. If Russia orders A Mos-TRS-Vla and China orders A Mac-Irk and A Mon-Kra, what happens?
# A. A Mon-Kra fails, A Mac-Irk succeeds, A Mos stops in Omsk.

# Additional assumptions

# The additional rules and the errata do not explain everything. Therefore the following assumptions are made in the resolutions of the test cases (note, these are disputable):

# A move with the Trans-Siberian Railroad can bounce on a Russian unit.
# This is not obvious, since a Russian army can rail through another Russian army. This follows implicitly from an example in the errata.
# A Russian army can rail through another Russian army as long it is not dislodged. The army railing through will not be part of a beleaguered garrison.
# A Russian army using the Trans-Siberian Railroad can only receive support on the final part of the move.
# Since there is no notation for support on other parts of the move, it is assumed that this is not possible.
# A move with the Trans-Siberian Railroad can not cut support.
# According to the errata an attack will be unsuccessful when a unit stays in place. So, it is assumed that it can not cut support.
# When a unit is ordered to go with the Trans-Siberian Railroad and the first place the unit has to pass contains another unit moving in the opposite direction, then the Trans-Siberian Railroad order should be treated as a normal move to the first place the unit wanted to pass, but without the ability dislodging the other unit.
# So, in such case there is just a head to head battle (without the ability to dislodge by the unit using the Trans-Siberian Railroad).
# In case of a paradoxical situation which includes a move with the Trans-Siberian Railroad, at least the last part of the move that is part of the paradoxical situation fails, but is still capable of bouncing other units.
# When this rule is applied it may result that earlier parts of the move with the Trans-Siberian railroad also fail.
# The Trans-Siberian Railroad can not be used during retreat.
# When two units are ordered to use the Trans-Siberian Railroad, they both hold (able to receive a hold support).
# Only one unit can get permission to go through to the Suez Canal.
# This means that if there is an explicit permission and a possible implicit permission, the implicit permission is denied. If there are two possible implicit permissions, then both permissions are denied.
# In case of a paradoxical situation which includes the Suez Canal, the move through the Suez Canal fails and the fleet moving through the Suez Canal does not have any effect on its ordered destination.
# This is an extension of the Szykman rule for resolving paradoxes.
# In case there is combination of the Trans-Siberian Railroad, the Suez Canal and a possibly disrupted convoy in a paradox, all paradox rules should be applied at the same time
# So, there is no priority for the paradox rules for the Trans-Siberian Railroad, the Suez Canal and disrupted convoys.
# The Sakhalin story

# On the first print of the Colonial variant map there is no land bridge between Sakhalin and Otaru and there is no land bridge between Sakhalin Vladivostok. This introduces the problem that a unit in Sakhalin can not be dislodged, because Sakhalin has only one neighbor (Okhotsk Sea). Since this area has also a supply center, the area can supply itself.

# In the second print of the Colonial variant map and in the errata, Avalon Hill "corrected" this problem by adding a land bridge between Sakhalin and Otaru. However, this introduced a new problem. Two units in Sakhalin and Otaru can support each other and supply there selves forever. And some argue that this situation is even worse then the original problem.

# There are several ways to solve this problems. One of the most common played versions is the "Moulmein Convention". In that convention there is a second additional land bridge between Otaru and Akita. However, according to Peter Hawes, the lead designer of the Colonial variant, the original design contained a land bridge between Sakhalin and Vladivostok (and no land bridge between Sakhalin and Otaru). Avalon Hill omitted this land bridge by mistake. You should realize that this is a large change to the map and Avalon Hill never made an errata in this direction. Some people argue that a land bridge between Sakhalin and Vladivostok is very bad, because Japan can be denied any build in the first build turn. However, that this is not different from the standard game where at least England and Russia can be denied any build in the first build turn.

# I prefer the land bridge between Sakhalin and Vladivostok. I think that the many land bridges in the Moulmein Convention destroys the interesting geographical situation in that area and makes it too easy for Japan to defend. A common complaint is that Japan is too strong (to only way to beat Japan is to start bashing it from the start of the game). With the land bridge between Sakhalin and Vladivostok, Russia has to make a difficult choice. It can take Sakhalin at the first turn (with a rather useless army on Sakhalin) or try to move the army in the direction of Seoul and Fusan. I think that this makes the situation much more interesting and gives a better balance to the game.

# 7.A. TEST CASES, HONG KONG OPTIONAL RULE

# 7.A.1 TEST CASE, HONG KONG IS NOT A SUPPLY CENTER FOR CHINA

# Move Chinese army to Hong Kong in fall. China should not have the right to build a unit for the Hong Kong supply center.

# 7.A.2. TEST CASE, HONG KONG IS A SUPPLY CENTER FOR OTHER COUNTRIES

# We know it is for Britain. But for France? Move French army to Hong Kong in fall. France should have the right to build a unit for the additional Hong Kong supply center.

# 7.A.3. TEST CASE, HONG KONG DOES NOT COUNT FOR VICTORY FOR CHINA

# Set victory condition to 30 (long game). Let China own 29 supply centers which does not include Hong Kong. Let China own Hong Kong. China has not won yet.

# 7.B. TEST CASE, TRANS SIBERIAN RAILROAD OPTIONAL RULE

# 7.B.1. TEST CASE, TSR BOUNCING ON ARMY OF OTHER COUNTRY

# Along the railroad, the army can bounce.

    Russia:
# A Moscow - TSR - Irkutsk

    Turkey:
# A Orenburg - Omsk
# Armies will bounce in Omsk. The Russian army will end in Perm and the Turkish army will stay in Orenburg.

# 7.B.2. TEST CASE, TSR CAN NOT PASS A SUPPORTED ARMY

# If along the railroad, another armies move in with support, the army will bounce.

    Russia:
# A Moscow - TSR - Irkutsk

    Turkey:
# A Orenburg - Omsk
# A Akmolinsk Supports A Orenburg - Omsk
# The Russian army will end in Perm and the Turkish will move to Omsk.

# 7.B.3. TEST CASE, TSR CAN MOVE THROUGH RUSSIAN ARMY

# If along the railroad, a Russian army is holding, the army using the TSR should move through the army.

    Russia:
# A Moscow - TSR - Vladivostok
# A Omsk Hold
# Army should pass through the army in Omsk and end in Vladivostok.

# 7.B.4, TEST CASE, TSR BOUNCES ON RUSSIAN ARMY

# If along the railroad, a Russian army is moving in, the army using the TSR will not move through the army, but will bounce on it.

    Russia:
# A Moscow - TSR - Vladivostok
# A Akmolinsk - Omsk
# Both armies bounces in Omsk. The army in Moscow will end in Perm and the army in Akmolinsk will stay in Akmolinsk.

# 7.B.5. TEST CASE, BOUNCING WHILE PASSING THROUGH A RUSSIAN ARMY

# If an army using the TSR is passing through another Russian, but can not go further, it should not end with two units in the same sector.

    Russia:
# A Moscow - TSR -Vladivostok
# A Omsk Hold

# China:
# A Mongolia - Krasnoyarsk
# The Russian army and the Chinese army bounce in Krasnoyarsk. The Russian army will end in Perm and the Chinese army will stay in Mongolia.

# 7.B.6. TEST CASE, TSR CAN PASS WHEN TWO ARMIES BOUNCE

# When two armies bounce on one of the sectors on the TSR, the army using the TSR can still pass.

    Russia:
# A Moscow - TSR - Vladivostok
# A Semipalatinsk - Krasnoyarsk

# China:
# A Mongolia - Krasnoyarsk
# The Russian and Chinese army bounce in Krasnoyarsk. This makes it possible that the army using the TSR ends in Vladivostok.

# 7.B.7. TEST CASE, TSR CAN PASS WHEN TWO ARMIES WITH EQUAL SUPPORT BOUNCE

# Comparable with the previous test case, but now the bouncing armies have support.

    Russia:
# A Moscow - TSR - Vladivostok

# China:
# A Manchuria Supports A Seoul - Vladivostok
# A Seoul - Vladivostok

# Japan:
# F Okhotsk Sea - Vladivostok
# F Sea of Japan Supports F Okhotsk Sea - Vladivostok
# Since the Japanese fleet and the Chinese army bounce in Vladivostok, the army from Moscow can slip through and end in Vladivostok.

# 7.B.8. TEST CASE, TSR BOUNCES WHEN OTHER FORCES ARE UNBALANCED

# Comparable with the previous test case, but now the two other moving units are unbalanced and the TSR can not take advantage of that.

    Russia:
# A Moscow - TSR - Vladivostok
# A Manchuria Supports A Moscow - Vladivostok

# China:
# A Seoul - Vladivostok

# Japan:
# F Okhotsk Sea - Vladivostok
# F Sea of Japan Supports F Okhotsk Sea - Vladivostok
# Now the Russian army from Moscow bounces with the fleet from Japan. And the Russian army will end in Irkutsk

# 7.B.9. TEST CASE, TSR CAN PASS TRHOUGH AS LONG AS RUSSIAN ARMY HOLDS

# When an army using the TSR passes through another Russian army on the railroad, and that army holds, it will pass as long as the Russian holds. Even when it is under attack. The army using the TSR is not part of a beleaguered garrison.

    Russia:
# A Moscow - TSR - Vladivostok
# A Krasnoyarsk Hold

# China:
# A Mongolia - Krasnoyarsk
# The army from Moscow will not bounce on the army from Mongolia, because the army in Krasnoyarsk is defending the place.

# 7.B.10. TEST CASE, TSR CAN PASS EVEN WHEN RUSSIAN ARMY IS MOVING AWAY

# When an army using the TSR passes through another Russian army on the railroad, and that army tries to move away, it can still have benefit from the army moving away, when that army bounces.

    Russia:
# A Moscow - TSR - Vladivostok
# A Krasnoyarsk - Semipalatinsk

# China:
# A Mongolia - Krasnoyarsk
# A Urumchi - Semipalatinsk
# The army in Krasnoyarsk bounces in Semipalatinsk and remains in Krasnoyarsk, it can still help the army from Moscow passing through Krasnoyarsk. The army from Moscow will end in Vladivostok.

# 7.B.11. TEST CASE, TSR CAN ONLY BOUNCE ONCE

# When an army using the TSR bounces, it has no effect on the remaining part of the move.

    Russia:
# A Moscow - TSR - Vladivostok

# China:
# A Mongolia - Krasnoyarsk
# A Manchuria - Irkutsk
# The Russian army will bounce in Krasnoyarsk and end in Omsk. The Chinese army in Mongolia will bounce and stay in Mongolia. The army in Manchuria will just move to Irkutsk.

# 7.B.12. TEST CASE, COMPLEX BOUNCE WITH TSR

# The adjudicator can easily choke on a bounce of the departure of the TSR.

    Russia:
# A Moscow - TSR - Vladivostok
# A Perm - Orenburg

# Britain:
# A Tashkent - Orenburg
# A Akmolinsk - Omsk

    Turkey:
# A Baku - Moscow
# The army from Moscow can pass through Perm, but will bounce on the British army in Omsk. It can not end in Perm, because the army in Perm bounces also. The army has to stay in Moscow. This means that the move of Turkey will fail.

# 7.B.13. TEST CASE, A MOVE WITH THE TSR CAN NOT DISLODGE UNIT

# A move with the TSR is not an attack, so it can not dislodge a unit.

    Russia:
# A Moscow - TSR - Vladivostok
# A Irkutsk Supports A Moscow - Vladivostok

# China:
# A Vladivostok Hold
# Although the support from Irkutsk is possible, the Chinese army in Vladivostok is not dislodged.

# 7.B.14. TEST CASE, A MOVE WITH THE TSR CAN NOT CUT SUPPORT

# A move with the TSR is not an attack, so it can not cut support.

    Russia:
# A Moscow - TSR - Vladivostok
# A Seoul Hold

# China:
# A Vladivostok Supports A Manchuria - Seoul
# A Manchuria - Seoul
# The support of Vladivostok is not cut. So, the Russian army in Seoul is dislodged.

# 7.B.15. TEST CASE, A MOVE WITH THE TSR CAN RECEIVE A SUPPORT TO WIN A BATTLE

# Although a move with the TSR is not an attack and can not dislodge a unit, it can win a battle when the sector is initially empty. Note, that a move with the TSR can only receive support on the last part of the move.

    Russia:
# A Moscow - TSR - Vladivostok
# A Irkutsk Supports A Moscow - Vladivostok

# Japan:
# F Okhotsk Sea - Vladivostok
# The Russian move with the TSR succeeds and ends in Vladivostok. The Japanese fleet will stay in the Okhotsk Sea.

# 7.B.16. TEST CASE, A MOVE WITH THE TSR CAN PREVENT DISLODGEMENT

# Although a move with the TSR is not an attack and can not dislodge a unit, it can prevent that it is dislodged by another unit.

    Russia:
# A Moscow - TSR - Vladivostok
# A Manchuria Supports A Moscow - Vladivostok

# Japan:
# F Okhotsk Sea - Vladivostok
# F Sea of Japan Supports F Okhotsk Sea - Vladivostok

# China:
# A Vladivostok Hold
# The Russian move with the TSR prevents that the Japanese fleet in the Okhotsk Sea will dislodge the Chinese fleet in Vladivostok.

# 7.B.17. TEST CASE, CIRCULAR MOVEMENT WITH THE TSR IS POSSIBLE

# Well, look if the adjudicator can handle circular movement.

    Russia:
# A Omsk Hold
# A Krasnoyarsk - TSR - Moscow

# China:
# A Perm - Orenburg
# A Orenburg - Akmolinsk
# A Akmolinsk - Krasnoyarsk

    Turkey:
# A Odessa - Moscow
# The Russian army in Krasnoyarsk will bounce in Moscow on the Turkish army. But the Russian army and the Chinese armies can still make a circular movement. All Chinese armies will move and the Russian army will end in Perm.

# 7.B.18. TEST CASE, TSR CAN NOT PASS AN UNOWNED SUPPLY CENTER

# It must recapture supply center first (Avalon Hill errata).

# Omsk is not owned by Russia.

    Russia:
# A Moscow - TSR - Vladivostok
# Move will end in Omsk.

# 7.B.19. TEST CASE, TSR MAY LEAVE AN UNOWNED SUPPLY CENTER

# An army may leave an unowned supply center on TSR. This will probably only occur when Russia cooperates with another power and does not want to take over the supply center.

# Omsk is not owned by Russia.

    Russia:
# A Omsk - TSR - Vladivostok
# Move will end in Vladivostok.

# 7.B.20. TEST CASE, TSR CAN PASS AN UNOWNED SUPPLY CENTER WHEN ANOTHER ARMY IS HOLDING

# If an army is holding an unowned supply center, the TSR does not need to stop there.

# Omsk is not owned by Russia.

    Russia:
# A Moscow - TSR - Vladivostok
# A Omsk Hold
# Army in Moscow will end in Vladivostok.
# 7.B.21. TEST CASE, TSR CAN NOT PASS AN UNOWNED SUPPLY CENTER WHEN ARMY IS MOVING AWAY

# When another army holding the unowned supply center moves away, the TSR should recapture it.

# Omsk is not owned by Russia.

    Russia:
# A Moscow - TSR - Vladivostok
# A Omsk - Akmolinsk
# Army in Moscow must stop in Omsk to capture the supply center.

# 7.B.22. TEST CASE, TSR CAN PASS AN UNOWNED SUPPLY CENTER WHEN ARMY MOVING AWAY BOUNCES

# Well when the army bounces, the TSR can just go on.

# Omsk is not owned by Russia.

    Russia:
# A Moscow - TSR - Vladivostok
# A Omsk - Akmolinsk

# Britain:
# A Tashkent - Akmolinsk
# The army from Moscow does not need to stop in Omsk, since the army there bounces. The army from Moscow ends in Vladivostok.

# 7.B.23. TEST CASE, SIMPLE TWO ARMY TSR PARADOX

# A Russian army can rail through another army. But when that army moves, it bounces.

    Russia:
# A Moscow - TSR - Vladivostok
# A Omsk - Krasnoyarsk
# The part from Perm to Omsk and Omsk to Krasnoyarsk is part of the paradoxical situation. The part from Omsk to Krasnoyarsk fails, but is still able to bounce the army that comes from Omsk. This means that the TSR move ends in Perm and the army Omsk stays in Omsk

# 7.B.24. TEST CASE, COMPLEX TSR PARADOX

# This paradox involves more armies.

    Russia:
# A Moscow - TSR - Vladivostok

# Britain:
# A Perm - Orenburg
# A Orenburg - Akmolinsk
# A Akmolinsk - Krasnoyarsk

# China:
# A Manchuria - Irkutsk
# Whether the army Moscow can reach Krasnoyarsk is part of the paradoxical situation. According to the paradox rule, the part from Omsk to Krasnoyarsk fails, but is still able to bounce the British army in Akmolinsk. When this is decided, we continue with the normal rules. The move from Perm to Orenburg will fail and that means that the army in Moscow can not pass Perm and will stay in Moscow. The Chinese move from Manchuria to Irkutsk is not part of the paradoxical situation. This move will succeed.

# 7.B.25. TEST CASE, TSR SUPPLY CENTER PARADOX

# The need to recapture the supply center can cause a paradox.

# Omsk is not owned by Russia.

    Russia:
# A Moscow - TSR - Vladivostok
# A Omsk - Akmolinsk
# A Krasnoyarsk Hold

# China:
# A Akmolinsk - Semipalatinsk
# A Semipalatinsk - Urumchi
# A Urumchi - Mongolia
# A Mongolia - Irkutsk
# There are two resolutions to this set of orders in which all rules are obeyed. You can say that all Chinese armies move and the Russian army in Omsk moves. In this way the TSR has to stop in Omsk to recapture the Supply center. The other resolution is that the army in Omsk does not move. In that case, the TSR can bounce in Irkutsk with the Chinese army. And this will indeed cause the army in Omsk not to move. The paradox rule says the last part of the paradoxical situation (the part from Krasnoyrask to Irkutsk) fails but is still able to bounce another army. So, all Chinese armies will not move and the Russian army in Moscow will end in Perm.

# 7.B.26. TEST CASE, BALANCED HEAD TO HEAD BATTLE WITH TSR

# Look if the adjudicator can handle this.

    Russia:
# A Moscow - TSR - Omsk
# A Perm - Moscow
# Both armies fail to move.

# 7.B.27. TEST CASE, UNBALANCED HEAD TO HEAD BATTLE WITH TSR

# Now the army is attacked in is departure place.

    Russia:
# A Moscow - TSR - Omsk

# Britain:
# A Perm - Moscow
# A Orenburg - Perm
# A Baku Supports A Perm - Moscow

# The British army in Perm will dislodge the army in Moscow and the army in Orenburg will advance to Perm (not bounced).

# 7.B.28. TEST CASE, SUPPORTED HEAD TO HEAD BATTLE WITH TSR

# A supported head to head battle must also be handled correctly.

# Britain:
# A Perm - Moscow
# A Orenburg Supports A Perm - Moscow

    Russia:
# A Moscow - TSR - Perm
# A Omsk Supports A Moscow - Perm
# No unit will move.

# 7.B.29. TEST CASE, TSR CAN'T DISLODGE IN HEAD TO HEAD BATTLE

# Although the TSR can win a head to head battle, it can not dislodge a unit.

# Britain:
# A Perm - Moscow

    Russia:
# A Moscow - TSR - Perm
# A Omsk Supports A Moscow - Perm
# No unit will move.

# 7.B.30. TEST CASE, DEPARTURE PLACE DISLODGE WITH SUPPORT FROM ARMY ON TSR

# Now, the support is coming from the army that is on the TSR.

    Russia:
# A Moscow - TSR - Omsk

# Britain:
# A Perm Supports A Orenburg - Moscow
# A Orenburg - Moscow
# The British army in Orenburg will dislodge the army in Moscow.

# 7.B.31. TEST CASE, TSR PARADOX WITH DEPARTING TRAIN

# Whether the train leaves or not, can cause a paradox.

    Russia:
# A Moscow - TSR - Krasnoyarsk
# A Perm Hold
# A Orenburg - Moscow
# A Omsk - Orenburg

# Britain:
# A Akmolinsk - Omsk
# If the army in Omsk stays, the TSR can slip trough and end in Krasnoyarsk. But in that case the other Russian armies can advance end the army in Omsk does not stay. If the army in Omsk leaves, the TSR bounces on the British army. The army has to stay in Moscow. This makes it impossible that the army in Omsk leaves. According to the paradox rule, the last part of the paradoxical situation (that is the part from Perm to Omsk) fails but is still able to bounce another army. So, the army in Moscow stays in Moscow and the British army in Akmolinks stays in Akmolinsk.

# 7.B.32. TEST CASE, NO RETREAT WITH TSR

# It is not allowed to use a convoy during retreat. Assume the same for the Trans-Siberian Railroad.

    Russia:
# A Moscow Hold

    Turkey:
# A Odessa - Moscow
# A Baku Supports A Odessa - Moscow
# Army in Moscow is dislodged. When Russia retreats as follows:

# A Moscow TSR Vladivostok
# This is illegal and the army in Moscow is disbanded.

# 7.B.33. TEST CASE, ONLY ONE UNIT CAN USE THE TSR

# A short circuit occurs when two units are starting to use the Trans-Siberian Railroad.

    Russia:
# A Moscow - TSR - Omsk
# A Vladivostok - TSR - Krasnoyarsk
# Both moves fail (they can receive support to hold).

# 7.B.34. TEST CASE, ONLY RUSSIA MAY USE THE TSR

# Other countries are not able to control this advanced technology.

    Turkey:
# A Moscow - TSR - Perm
# The move fails (without the attempt to use the Trans-Siberian Railroad, the move would succeed).

# 7.C. TEST CASES, SUEZ CANAL OPTIONAL RULE

# 7.C.1. TEST CASE, FLEET CAN NOT TAKE SUEZ CANAL IF NOT PERMITTED

# The fleet that wants to use the Suez Canal must have permission.

    Turkey:
# A Egypt Hold

    Russia:
# F Mediterranean Sea - Red Sea
# The move of the Russian fleet fails, because it has no permission.

# 7.C.2. TEST CASE, FLEET CAN TAKE SUEZ CANAL IF PERMITTED

# The fleet that wants to use the Suez Canal must have permission.

    Turkey:
# A Egypt Hold
# SC F Mediterranean Sea - Red Sea

    Russia:
# F Mediterranean Sea - Red Sea
# The move of the Russian fleet succeeds.

# 7.C.3. TEST CASE, IMPLICIT PERMISSION FOR OWN UNIT

# It is not necessary to give permission to own unit.

    Turkey:
# A Egypt Hold
# F Mediterranean Sea - Red Sea
# The move of the Turkish fleet succeeds.

# 7.C.4. TEST CASE, EXPLICIT PERMISSION DENIES IMPLICIT PERMISSION

# Only one unit gets permission. That means that when a unit is given permission, own units do not get permission.

    Russia:
# F Egypt Supports F Mediterranean Sea - Red Sea
# F Mediterranean Sea - Red Sea
# SC F Red Sea - Mediterranean Sea

# Britain:
# F Mecca Supports F Aden - Red Sea
# F Aden - Red Sea

    Turkey:
# F Red Sea - Mediterranean Sea
# Since Russia gives explicit permission to the Turkish fleet, the permission to its own fleet in the Mediterranean Sea is denied. That means that the move Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea fails and that there is no beleaguered garrison in the Red Sea. The British fleet in Aden will dislodge the Turkish fleet in the Red Sea.

# 7.C.5. TEST CASE, ONLY ONE IMPLICIT PERMISSION

# When both own units try to move through the canal, none of them gets permission.

    Russia:
# F Egypt Supports F Mediterranean Sea - Red Sea
# F Mediterranean Sea - Red Sea
# F Red Sea - Mediterranean Sea

# Britain:
# F Mecca Supports F Aden - Red Sea
# F Aden - Red Sea
# Both the move from Mediterranean Sea to Red Sea as the move from Red Sea to Mediterranean fail, because they don't get permission (only one unit can get permission). That means that the fleet in the Red Sea is not part of a beleaguered garrison and will be dislodged by the British fleet in Aden.

# 7.C.6. TEST CASE, NO HEAD TO HEAD BATTLE THROUGH CANAL

# Since only one unit can get permission a head to head battle through the canal is not possible.

    Turkey:
# F Egypt Supports F Mediterranean Sea - Red Sea
# F Mediterranean Sea - Red Sea

# Britain:
# F Red Sea - Mediterranean Sea
# F Syria Supports F Red Sea - Mediterranean Sea
# The British fleet in the Red Sea does not have permission and that move fails. So, there is no head to head battle. The attack from the Turkish fleet in the Mediterranean Sea on the Red Sea is just two to one and will dislodge the English fleet in the Red Sea.

# 7.C.7. TEST CASE, CIRCULAR MOVEMENT THROUGH THE CANAL

# Circular movement with a move through the canal is possible.

    Turkey:
# F Egypt Hold
# F Mediterranean Sea - Red Sea
# F Red Sea - Mecca
# A Mecca - Syria
# F Syria - Mediterranean Sea
# All units except the unit in Egypt will advance.

# 7.C.8. TEST CASE, SUEZ CANAL MOVE OUT PARADOX

# If the Egyptian fleet just follows the fleet using the Suez Canal, you have a paradox.

    Turkey:
# F Mediterranean Sea - Red Sea
# F Egypt - Mediterranean Sea
# If the fleet in the Mediterranean Sea moves, the fleet in Egypt can also moves, which makes the move of the Mediterranean Sea impossible. In case of a paradox the Suez Canal move fails. So, both units hold. Note that in this case it is insufficient to use a paradox rule that says that only the support is not cut (comparable to the 1971 rule with possible disrupted convoys, see issue 4.A.2).

# 7.C.9. TEST CASE, SCHWARZ'S FIRST SUEZ CANAL PARADOX

# A more complex move out paradox.

# Britain:
# A Egypt - Mecca
# A Syria Supports A Egypt - Mecca
# F Mediterranean Sea - Red Sea

    Turkey:
# A Arabia - Mecca
# F Red Sea Supports A Arabia - Mecca
# If the support in the Red Sea is cut, the army in Egypt can move out. But when it moves out, the support in the Red Sea can not be cut. When the paradox rule is used, the fleet in Mediterranean Sea fails to move and does not have any effect on the Red Sea. That means that there is still a bounce in Mecca and the army in Egypt and Arabia will fail to move.

# 7.C.10. TEST CASE, SCHWARZ'S SECOND SUEZ CANAL PARADOX

# In this paradox, the army in Egypt does not move out, but can be dislodged.

    Russia:
# F Mediterranean Sea - Red Sea
# F Egypt Hold

# Britain:
# F Red Sea Supports A Sudan - Egypt
# A Sudan - Egypt

    Turkey:
# A Syria - Egypt
# A Mecca Supports A Syria - Egypt
# When the support of the Red Sea is cut, the fleet in Egypt will be dislodged. But, when the fleet in Egypt is dislodged, the support can not be cut. According to the paradox rule, the fleet in the Mediterranean Sea will not advance and not cut support. This means that the fleet in Egypt is not dislodged.

# 7.C.11. TEST CASE, SCHWARZ'S THIRD SUEZ CANAL PARADOX

# This case is similar to the previous case, but now the fleet in the Red Sea is completely dislodged if the fleet in the Mediterranean is allowed through the canal.

    Russia:
# F Mediterranean Sea - Red Sea
# F Egypt Hold
# F Eritrea Supports F Mediterranean Sea - Red Sea

# Britain:
# F Red Sea Supports A Sudan - Egypt
# A Sudan - Egypt

    Turkey:
# A Syria - Egypt
# A Mecca Supports A Syria - Egypt
# This should be handled similar to the previous test case. The fleet in the Mediterranean Sea will fail to move and not cut support. That means that the fleet in the Red Sea will not be dislodged and can give support. The fleet in Egypt will not be dislodged. Note that in this case it is insufficient to use a paradox rule that says that only the support is not cut (comparable to the 1971 rule with possible disrupted convoys, see issue 4.A.2). If only the support would not be cut, then the fleet in the Red Sea is dislodged, but still gives valid support. This violates the dislodge rule.

# 7.C.12. TEST CASE, SCHWARZ'S PARADOX ADAPTED TO TWO RESOLUTIONS

# The Schwarz paradoxes have all in common that there are no consistent resolutions. This adapted version has two consistent resolutions.

    Russia:
# F Mediterranean Sea - Red Sea
# F Egypt Hold

# Britain:
# F Red Sea Supports A Sudan - Egypt
# A Sudan - Egypt
# One consistent resolution is that the fleet in the Mediterranean Sea cuts the support of the Red Sea. In this way the fleet in Egypt is not dislodged. The other resolution is that the fleet in the Mediterranean Sea does not cut support of the Red Sea, which means that the fleet in Egypt is dislodged by the army in Sudan. Since it is dislodged, the fleet in the Mediterranean indeed fails to cut the support in the Red Sea.

# When the paradox rule is used, then the fleet in the Mediterranean Sea fails to move and does not cut the support in the Red Sea. That means that the fleet in Egypt is dislodged by the army in Sudan.

# 7.C.13. TEST CASE, SUEZ CANAL DISRUPTED CONVOY PARADOX WITH TWO RESOLUTIONS

# The Suez canal paradoxes can be combined with convoys that are possibly disrupted.

    Turkey:
# A Egypt Hold
# F Mecca Supports F Mediterranean Sea - Red Sea
# F Mediterranean Sea - Red Sea

# Britain:
# F Red Sea Convoys A Aden - Egypt
# A Sudan Supports A Aden - Egypt
# A Aden - Egypt
# There are two resolutions that are consistent with the rules. The Egyptian army is dislodged or the fleet in the Red Sea is dislodged.

# If the 1982 rule is used (see issue 4.A.2) for resolving disrupted convoy paradoxes, then there is nothing for this rule to apply. In that case only the paradox rule for the Suez Canal has to be applied. That means that the fleet in the Mediterranean Sea will fail to move. The army in Aden convoys to Egypt, dislodging the army in Egypt.

# When the Szykman rule is used (which I prefer) or the 'All Hold' rule, then the convoy from Aden to Egypt is part of the paradoxical situation. Therefore, this convoy fails. So, both the fleet in the Mediterranean Sea as well as the army in Aden do not move.

# 7.C.14. TEST CASE, SUEZ CANAL DISRUPTED CONVOY PARADOX WITH NO RESOLUTION

# Comparable with the previous test case, but now there is no resolution that is consistent with the rules.

    Turkey:
# A Egypt - Sudan
# F Mecca Supports F Mediterranean Sea - Red Sea
# F Mediterranean Sea - Red Sea

# Britain:
# F Red Sea Convoys A Aden - Sudan
# A Aden - Sudan
# If the British fleet in the Red Sea is dislodged by the Turkish fleet in the Mediterranean Sea, then the Turkish army in Egypt will not bounce on the convoying army in Aden. But in that case, the fleet in the Mediterranean Sea may not move. But if it not moves, the army in Egypt will bounce on the army in Aden.

# If the 1982 rule is used (see issue 4.A.2) for resolving disrupted convoy paradoxes, then there is nothing for this rule to apply. In that case only the paradox rule for the Suez Canal has to be applied. That means that the fleet in the Mediterranean Sea will fail to move and not cut support. The army in Aden bounces on the army from Egypt in Sudan. So, both armies will fail to move.

# If the Szykman rule is used (which I prefer), then the convoy will also fail to move and have no effect on Sudan. That means that the army in Egypt can move to Sudan.

# If the 'All Hold' rule is used, then the army in Egypt is part of the paradox and should also hold. That means that none of the units will move.

# 7.D. TEST CASES, TRANS-SIBERIAN RAILROAD AND SUEZ CANAL COMBINED ISSUES

# 7.D.1. TEST CASES, CIRCULAR MOVEMENT WITH TSR, CONVOY AND SUEZ CANAL

# A gigantic circular movement is possible.

# Britain:
# F Gulf of Aden Convoys A Eritrea - Vladivostok
# F Red Sea - Eritrea
# F West Indian Ocean Convoys A Eritrea - Vladivostok
# A Eritrea - Vladivostok

# China:
# F Sea of Japan Convoys A Eritrea - Vladivostok

    Russia:
# A Irkutsk Hold
# A Vladivostok - TSR - Moscow
# A Perm Hold
# A Omsk Hold
# A Krasnoyarsk Hold
# All units ordered to move, will do so.

# 7.D.2. TEST CASE, KRUIJSWIJK'S PARADOX

# A paradox that contains the Suez Canal, the Trans-Siberian Railroad and a possible disrupted convoy, is possible.

# Britain:
# F Gulf of Aden Convoys A Sudan - Manchuria
# F Red Sea Convoys A Sudan - Manchuria
# A Sudan - Manchuria
# F West Indian Ocean Convoys A Sudan - Manchuria

# China:
# A Manchuria Supports A Mongolia - Irkutsk
# A Mongolia - Irkutsk

    France:
# F South China Sea Convoys A Sudan - Manchuria
# F Sunda Sea Convoys A Sudan - Manchuria

# Japan:
# F East China Sea Convoys A Sudan - Manchuria
# F Yellow Sea Convoys A Sudan - Manchuria

    Turkey:
# A Armenia - Baku
# A Baku - Moscow
# A Egypt - Syria
# F Mecca Supports F Mediterranean Sea - Red Sea
# F Mediterranean Sea - Red Sea
# A Syria - Armenia

# Holland:
# F Java Sea Convoys A Sudan - Manchuria
# F Southeast Indian Ocean Convoys A Sudan - Manchuria

    Russia:
# A Irkutsk Hold
# A Vladivostok - Moscow
# If the British fleet is dislodged in the Red Sea, the Convoy from Sudan to Mancharia will fail. That means that the support of Mancharia is not cut and the Russian army in Irkutsk is dislodged. This prevents that the army in Vladivostok will not go to Moscow for a bounce on the Turkish army in Baku. So, all Turkish armies will move, including the army in Egypt. But if the army in Egypt moves, the fleet in the Mediterranean Sea is not allowed to go to the Red Sea to dislodge the British fleet. etc. etc.

# Well, judge this whatever you like.

# 8. ICE VARIANT

# Some variants have 'ice' sectors. You can not move to an ice sector in fall or in winter (retreat). Nor can you give support in fall.

# This is used in variant Loeb9.

# 8.A. TEST CASE, MOVE TO AN ICE SECTOR

# Move in winter to ice sector should fail.

# Loeb9 in fall:

# Norway:
# F Norwegian Sea - Arctic Ocean
# Move fails.

# 8.B. TEST CASE, MOVE FROM AN ICE SECTOR

# Move in winter from ice sector should fail.

# Loeb9 in fall:

# Norway:
# F Arctic Ocean - Norwegian Sea
# Move fails.

# 8.C. TEST CASE, SUPPORT FROM AN ICE SECTOR

# Support from an ice sector should fail in fall.

# Loeb9 in fall:

# Norway:
# F Arctic Ocean Supports F Norwegian Sea - North Atlantic Ocean
# F Norwegian Sea - North Atlantic Ocean

# England:
# F North Atlantic Ocean Hold
# English fleet in North Atlantic Ocean should not be dislodged.

# 8.D. TEST CASE, NO RETREAT TO AN ICE SECTOR

# Retreat to an ice sector in autumn should fail.

# Loeb9 in fall:

# England:
# F North Atlantic Ocean - Norwegian Sea
# F North Sea Supports F North Atlantic Ocean - Norwegian Sea

# Norway:
# F Norwegian Sea Hold
# Fleet of Norway is dislodged. It can not retreat to the Artic Sea.

# 8.E. TEST CASE, NO CONVOY IN ICE SECTOR

# A convoy in fall in an ice sector should fail.

# Loeb9 in fall:

# England:
# A Liverpool - Siberia
# F North Atlantic Ocean Convoys A Liverpool - Siberia
# F Arctic Ocean Convoys A Liverpool - Siberia
# Convoy fails and army stays in Liverpool.

# 9. CONVOYING COASTAL AREA VARIANT

# Some variants have coastal sectors in which convoying is allowed (for instance in Ancient Mediterranean). This introduces some difficulty in the rules, since convoys can now be disrupted by normal army movement or convoyed armies.

# To execute these test cases, the standard map should be adapted. The areas Denmark and Sweden are made convoyable coasts. Berlin and Denmark are connected for fleets. That means that fleets can move from Berlin to Denmark and vice versa, but armies can not.

# 9.A. TEST CASE, DISLODGING OWN CONVOY

# You can argue that your own convoy can be dislodged.

# Denmark changed in convoyable coastal area and Berlin and Denmark are connected for fleets:

# England:
# F Denmark Convoys A Berlin - Denmark

    Germany:
# A Kiel Supports A Berlin - Denmark

    Russia:
# A Berlin - Denmark
# Dislodging your own convoy is not possible. The English convoy order is illegal because it convoys to itself.

# 9.B. TEST CASE, CONVOYING TO OWN AREA WITH A LOOP

# You may argue that in the previous test case there was no legal convoyable path. Since Berlin - Denmark - Denmark contains a move from Denmark to Denmark. This can be changed by an additional convoying fleet

# Denmark changed in convoyable coastal area and Berlin and Denmark are connected for fleets:

# England:
# F Denmark Convoys A Berlin - Denmark

    Germany:
# A Kiel Supports A Berlin - Denmark

    Russia:
# A Berlin - Denmark
# F Skagerrak Convoys A Berlin - Denmark
# Now there is a convoy path Berlin - Denmark - Skagerrak - Denmark. Still, dislodging your own convoy is not possible. The English convoy order is illegal because it convoys to itself.

# 9.C. TEST CASE, CONVOY DISRUPTED BY ARMY

# Convoys can be disrupted by armies.

# Sweden changed in convoyable coastal area:

    Germany:
# A Denmark - St Petersburg
# F Sweden Convoys A Denmark - St Petersburg
# F Gulf of Bothnia Convoys A Denmark - St Petersburg

    Russia:
# A Finland - Sweden
# A Norway Supports A Finland - Sweden
# The German convoy is disrupted by the Russian army in Finland. Therefore, the German move to St Petersburg fails.

# 9.D. TEST CASE, CONVOY DISRUPTED BY CONVOYING ARMY

# Convoys can be disrupted by convoys.

# Sweden changed in convoyable coastal area:

    Germany:
# A Denmark - Finland
# F Sweden Convoys A Denmark - Finland

    Russia:
# F Gulf of Bothnia Convoys A St Petersburg - Sweden
# F Norway Supports A St Petersburg - Sweden
# A St Petersburg - Sweden
# The German convoy is disrupted by the Russian convoy. Therefore, the German move to Finland fails.

# 9.E. TEST CASE, TWO DISRUPTED CONVOYS PARADOX

# With the possible that a convoy can disrupt another convoy directly (without support cut) a new paradox is possible. Two convoys that disrupt each other directly.

# Denmark and Sweden changed in convoyable coastal areas:

    Germany:
# A Kiel - Sweden
# F Denmark Convoys A Kiel - Sweden
# F Skagerrak Supports A Kiel - Sweden

    Russia:
# F Sweden Convoys A Finland - Denmark
# A Finland - Denmark
# F Baltic Sea Supports A Finland - Denmark
# The German convoy disrupts the Russian convoy and the Russian convoy disrupts the German convoy.

# This can not be resolved with the 1971, the 1982 or 2000 rulebook (see also issue 4.A.2).

# When the Szykman (which I prefer) rule is used, both convoys fail. The 'All Hold' rule has the same result since there are no other units that move.

# 9.F. TEST CASE, DISRUPTED CONVOY SUPPORT PARADOX WITH NO RESOLUTION

# It is also possible that a convoy disrupts another convoys, while that convoy cuts the support targeting the convoy from which it is attacked.

# Sweden changed in convoyable coastal area:

    Germany:
# A Denmark - Finland
# F Sweden Convoys A Denmark - Finland
# A Norway Supports A Denmark - Finland

    Russia:
# F Gulf of Bothnia Convoys A St Petersburg - Sweden
# A St Petersburg - Sweden
# F Baltic Sea Supports A St Petersburg - Sweden

# England:
# F Finland Supports F Livonia - Gulf of Bothnia
# F Livonia - Gulf of Bothnia
# The result depends on which paradox rule is used (see issue 4.A.2). If the 1971 or 2000 rulebook is used, then there is no resolution.

# If the 1982 rulebook is used, the support of Finland is not cut. That means that the fleet in the Gulf of Bothnia is dislodged by the English fleet in Livonia. Since, this disrupts the Russian convoy starting in St Petersburg, the Russian army in St Petersburg will stay and the German fleet in Sweden is not dislodged.

# If the Szykman rule is used (which I prefer), both convoys are part of the paradoxical situation. So, the German army in Denmark and the Russian army in St Petersburg will not move. They have both no effect on the place where they supposed to move to. That means that the English support in Sweden is not cut and the Russian fleet in the Gulf of Bothnia is dislodged by the English fleet in Livonia.

# If the 'All Hold' rule is used, then the tree moves fail. So, the German army in Denmark, the Russian army in St Petersburg and the English fleet in Livonia all stay. So, the Russian fleet in the Gulf of Bothnia is not dislodged.

# 9.G. TEST CASE, DISRUPTED CONVOY SUPPORT PARADOX WITH TWO RESOLUTIONS

# The previous test case did not have a resolution that follows all normal rules. It can be changed in such way that there are two possible resolutions.

# Sweden changed in convoyable coastal area:

    Germany:
# A Denmark - Finland
# F Sweden Convoys A Denmark - Finland
# A Norway Supports A Denmark - Finland
# F Baltic Sea Supports F Livonia - Gulf of Bothnia
# F Livonia - Gulf of Bothnia

    Russia:
# F Gulf of Bothnia Convoys A St Petersburg - Sweden
# A St Petersburg - Sweden
# F Finland Supports F Gulf of Bothnia
# F Skagerrak Supports A St Petersburg - Sweden
# There are two resolutions. The German army in Denmark advances to Finland, cutting the support of the Russian fleet. The Russian fleet in the Gulf of Bothnia is dislodged, such that the fleet in Sweden will not be dislodged. The other resolution is that the army in St Petersburg dislodges the fleet in Sweden. This prevents that the support of the fleet in Finland is cut, such that the fleet in the Gulf of Bothnia will not be dislodged.

# The results depends on which paradox rule is used (see issue 4.A.2). When the 1971 or 2000 rulebook is used, there is no resolution.

# When the 1982 rulebook is used, then the support of the Russian fleet in Finland is not cut. That means that the Russian fleet in the Gulf of Bothnia is not dislodged and that the convoy from St Petersburg to Sweden is successful, dislodging the German fleet there. The German fleet in Livonia will stay.

# When the Szykman rule is used (which I prefer), both convoys fail and the support of the Russian fleet in Finland is not cut. This means that the fleet in the Gulf of Bothnia is not dislodged. So, no unit will move.

# When the 'All Hold' rule is used, then the army in Denmark, the army in St Petersburg and the fleet in Livonia will not move. So, no unit will move and no unit will be dislodged.

# 10. DIFFICULT PASSABLE BORDER VARIANT

# In some variants armies can move between two sectors but with one support less. If no support is given, then the move can not cut support. Support can not be given over this corridor.

# 10.A. TEST CASE, SUPPORT CAN NOT BE CUT OVER DIFFICULT PASSABLE BORDER

# If an army is passing a difficult passable border without any support, then it can not cut support.

# In Loeb9:

    Italy:
# A Naples - Sicily
# F Tyrrhenian Sea Hold

    Turkey:
# F Sicily Supports F Ionian Sea - Tyrrhenian Sea
# F Ionian Sea - Tyrrhenian Sea
# The support is not cut and the fleet in Tyrrhenian Sea is dislodged.

# 10.B. TEST CASE, MOVE OVER DIFFICULT PASSABLE BORDER WITH SUPPORTS CUT SUPPORTS

# If the move receives support, then it can cut support.

# In Loeb9:

    Italy:
# A Naples - Sicily
# F Ionian Sea Supports A Naples - Sicily
# F Tunis Supports F Rome - Tyrrhenian Sea
# F Rome - Tyrrhenian Sea

    Spain:
# F Sicily Supports F Tyrrhenian Sea
# F Tyrrhenian Sea Hold
# The support of Sicily is cut and the fleet in Tyrrhenian Sea is dislodged.

# 10.C. TEST CASE, MOVE OVER DIFFICULT PASSABLE BORDER CAN NOT BOUNCE WITH NORMAL MOVE

# A move over difficult passable border can not prevent another unit to move into the sector.

# In Loeb9:

    Spain:
# A Cordoba - North Africa

    Italy:
# A Tunis - North Africa
# Spanish move of army fails. The move of Italy succeeds.

# 10.D. TEST CASE, TWO MOVES OVER DIFFICULT PASSABLE BORDER CAN BOUNCE

# When two armies over a difficult passable border enter the same sector, they bounce. Test whether the adjudicator can handle this bounce with zero power.

# In Loeb9 with a changed map that has a difficult passable border between North Africa and Tunis:

    Spain:
# A Cordoba - North Africa

    Italy:
# A Tunis - North Africa
# Both armies bounce.

# 10.E. TEST CASE, SUPPORT CAN NOT BE GIVEN OVER DIFFICULT PASSABLE BORDER

# If the border is difficult to pass, it is impossible to give support over this border.

# In Loeb9:

    Italy:
# A Naples Supports F Tyrrhenian Sea - Sicily
# F Tyrrhenian Sea - Sicily

    Turkey:
# F Sicily Hold
# The army in Sicily should not be dislodged.

# 10.F. TEST CASE, SUPPORT PARADOX

# There is no known real paradox with the difficult passable borders. However, in this test case the question is which of the supports is cut.

# In Loeb9 with edited map that has a difficult passable border between Sicily and Tunis:

    Italy:
# A Sicily - Tunis
# A North Africa Supports A Sicily - Tunis

    Spain:
# A Cordoba - North Africa
# A Tunis Supports A Cordoba - North Africa
# Program should not come in an infinite loop. All armies should hold. Preferable, the adjudicator reports a symmetric cut of supports. That means both supports are cut or both supports are not cut.

# 10.G. TEST CASE, ALMOST PARADOX

# The previous test case extended with an additional fleet that prevents the paradox.

# In Loeb9 with edited map that has a difficult passable border between Sicily and Tunis:

    Italy:
# A Sicily - Tunis
# A North Africa Supports A Sicily - Tunis

    Spain:
# A Cordoba - North Africa
# A Tunis Supports A Cordoba - North Africa
# F Western Mediterranean Supports A Cordoba - North Africa
# Army in Cordoba should advance.

# Now test the same with an Italian fleet to see if there is no arbitrary decision in the adjudicator:

# In Loeb9 with edited map that has a difficult passable border between Sicily and Tunis:

    Italy:
# A Sicily - Tunis
# A North Africa Supports A Sicily - Tunis
# F Western Mediterranean Supports A Sicily - Tunis

    Spain:
# A Cordoba - North Africa
# A Tunis Supports A Cordoba - North Africa
# Now the army in Sicily should advance.

# 10.H. TEST CASE, CIRCULAR MOVEMENT WITH DIFFICULT PASSABLE BORDER

# Adjudicator may choke on a circular movement when one of the borders is difficult passable.

# In Loeb9:

    Italy:
# F Sicily - Tyrrhenian Sea
# F Tyrrhenian Sea - Naples
# A Naples - Sicily
# All units move.

# 10.I. TEST CASE, CIRCULAR MOVEMENT WITH BOUNCE

# Adjudicator may choke on a circular movement when one of the borders is difficult passable and the unit using this border is bounced.

# In Loeb9:

    Italy:
# F Sicily - Tyrrhenian Sea
# F Tyrrhenian Sea - Naples
# A Naples - Sicily

    Turkey:
# F Ionian Sea - Sicily
# No unit moves.

# 10.J. TEST CASE, CIRCULAR MOVEMENT CAN NOT BE DISRUPTED BY ARMY USING DIFFICULT PASSABLE BORDER

# When a circular movement is attacked by an army over a difficult passable order, the circular movement will just go on.

# In Loeb9:

    Italy:
# A North Africa - Tunis
# F Western Mediterranean - North Africa
# F Tunis - Western Mediterranean

    Spain:
# A Cordoba - North Africa
# The Spanish army in Cordoba will not move and not disrupt the moves of Italy. The Italian moves all succeed.

# 10.K. TEST CASE, DIFFICULT PASSABLE BORDER DURING RETREAT

# A difficult passable border is also difficult passable during retreat. That means that when two armies retreat to the same sector and one of the armies is using a difficult passable border, the army using the normal border has a successful retreat.

# In Loeb9:

    Italy:
# F Tyrrhenian Sea Hold
# A Naples Hold

    Turkey:
# A Apulia - Naples
# F Ionian Sea Supports A Apulia - Naples

    Spain:
# F Western Mediterranean Supports F Gulf of Lyon - Tyrrhenian Sea
# F Gulf of Lyon - Tyrrhenian Sea
# Both Italian units are dislodged. If they both retreat to Sicily, then the fleet in the Tyrrhenian Sea should advance and the army in Naples is disbanded.

# 10.L. TEST CASE, DIFFICULT PASSABLE BORDER IS PROPERTY OF BORDER NOT OF SECTOR

# Adjudicators may mark the two adjacent sectors difficult passable, but this is an incorrect situation.

# In Loeb9 with edited map that has a difficult passable border between Sicily and Tunis:

    Italy:
# F Western Mediterranean Supports A Tunis - North Africa
# A Tunis - North Africa

    Spain:
# A North Africa Hold
# Army in Tunis should advance.

# 10.M. TEST CASE, USING CONVOY INSTEAD OF DIFFICULT PASSABLE BORDER

# A difficult passable border can be by-passed by a convoy.

# In Loeb9:

    Italy:
# A Naples - Sicily via Convoy
# F Tyrrhenian Sea Convoys A Naples - Sicily
# F Ionian Sea Supports A Naples - Sicily

    Turkey:
# A Sicily Hold
# Since the move from Naples to Sicily is via convoy, the Turkish army in Sicily is dislodged.

# 10.N. TEST CASE, USING CONVOY INSTEAD OF DIFFICULT PASSABLE BORDER CUTS SUPPORT

# If a difficult passable border is by-passed by a convoy, then it cuts support.

# In Loeb9:

    Italy:
# A Naples - Sicily
# F Tyrrhenian Sea Convoys A Naples - Sicily
# F Ionian Sea Hold

    Turkey:
# F Sicily Supports F Aegean Sea - Ionian Sea
# F Aegean Sea - Ionian Sea
# Since the army in Naples is using a convoy, the support of the fleet in Sicily is cut. That means that the Italian fleet in the Ionian See is not dislodged.

# 10.O. TEST CASE, SUPPORT ON ATTACK ON OWN ARMY OVER DIFFICULT PASSABLE BORDER DOES NOT CUT SUPPORT

# A movement over a difficult passable border does not cut support. But what if the movement was supported by an army of the same power of the army that is attacked? I think it should still not cut support.

# In Loeb9:

    Italy:
# A Naples - Sicily
# F Ionian Sea Hold

    Spain:
# F Tyrrhenian Sea Supports A Naples - Sicily
# F Sicily Supports F Ionian Sea

    Turkey:
# F Greece Supports F Aegean Sea - Ionian Sea
# F Aegean Sea - Ionian Sea
# The support of Sicilia is not cut, that means that the fleet in the Ionian Sea is not dislodged.

# 11. BUILD IN ANY SUPPLY CENTER VARIANT

# Some variants allow building of units in any supply center that is owned. The Chaos variant uses this rule.

# 11.A. TEST CASE, CIVIL DISORDER

# Since there is no notion of 'home supply center', the 'civil disorder' rules changes. It is expected that any owned supply center is treated as home supply center.

# Chaos:

# Berlin owns Naples as only supply center.

# Berlin power has a unit in Prussia and Apulia.

# In Civil disorder the unit in Prussia should be removed.

# 12. 1898 VARIANT

# In the 1898 variant all powers start with one unit. The home supply centers have to be captured first, before it is allowed to build there. The problem with this variant is that the home supply centers, the starting units and the starting owning supply centers are not the same anymore. It should be possible to distinguish those in the data files that describe the variant.

# 12.A. TEST CASE, HOME SUPPLY CENTER HAS TO BE CAPTURED FIRST

# The home supply centers should not be marked owned when the game is started.

# 1898:

# Germany did not yet captured Munich, but may build one.

    Germany:
# Build A Munich
# Build fails.

# 12.B. TEST CASE, BUILD IN NON-STARTING POSITION ALLOWED

# Builds are restricted to the home supply centers and not to the starting positions of the units.

# 1898:

# Germany owns Munich, Munich is empty and Germany may build one.

    Germany:
# Build A Munich
# Build succeeds.

# 12.C. TEST CASE, COUNTRIES CAN STILL ONLY BUILD IN HOME SUPPLY CENTERS

# The notion of home supply center still exists. That means that builds in other supply centers are not allowed.

# 1898:

# Germany owns Warsaw, Warsaw is empty and Germany may build one.

    Germany:
# Build A Warsaw
# Build fails.

# 12.D. TEST CASE, CIVIL DISORDER STILL BASED ON HOME SUPPLY CENTERS

# When a unit has to be removed according to the civil disorder rules, then the distance should still be calculated from the home supply centers and not to the owned or starting supply centers.

# 1898:

# Russia owns St Petersburg and has a fleet in the Black Sea and the Norwegian Sea.

# Russia has to remove one unit but does not order anything.

# The fleet in the Norwegian Sea is removed.
