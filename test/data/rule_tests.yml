# Test cases transcribed from http://web.inter.nl.net/users/L.B.Kruijswijk
#
# Note: in `precondition`, `fleets` and `armies` are both optional.

# Currently, a support or convoy fails if its child order fails.
# TODO(cosmic): Should supports and convoys that aren't disrupted succeed even
#               if the supported/convoyed action fails?
#               Should we have testing check more than order success/fail? As
#               in convoy is not disrupted, but convoyed unit fails to move.
# TODO(cosmic): Support orders should have result in (success, invalid, cut, etc)
#               Move result in (succeed, fail) but consider storing (cut support,
#               disrupt convoy, etc) and bounces if they happen.
# TODO(cosmic): Illegal orders should be able to receive hold support, but not
#               move orders.
# TODO(cosmic): All support orders need to be looked at again -- including in judge.

## If the Szykman rule is followed (which I prefer), the move of the army in London will fail and will not cut support. That means that the fleet in the North Sea will not be dislodged.

## The 'All Hold' rule has the same result as the Szykman rule, but with a different reason. The move of the army in London and the move of the German fleet in Skagerrak will fail.

## If the 1971 rule is used about multi-route convoys (when one of the routes is disrupted, the convoy fails), this test case is just a simple paradox. For the 1971, 1982, 2000 and Szykman paradox rule, the support of the fleet in Naples is not cut and the fleet in Rome dislodges the fleet in the Tyrrhenian Sea. When the 'All Hold' rule is used, both the convoy of the army in Tunis as the move of the fleet in Rome will fail.
#
## When the 1982 rule is used about multi-route convoy disruption, then convoys are disrupted when all routes are disrupted (this is the rule I prefer). With this rule, the situation becomes paradoxical. According to the 1971 and 1982 paradox rules, the support given by the fleet in Naples is not cut, that means that the fleet in the Tyrrhenian Sea is dislodged.
#
## According to the 2000 ruling the fleet in the Tyrrhenian Sea is not "necessary" for the convoy and the support of Naples is cut and the fleet in the Tyrrhenian Sea is not dislodged.
#
## If the Szykman rule is used (which I prefer), the 'All Hold' rule or the DPTG, then there is no paradoxical situation. The support of Naples is cut and the fleet in the Tyrrhenian Sea is not dislodged.

## Again, two issues play a role. The ruling about disruption of multi-route convoys (issue 4.A.1) and the issue how paradoxes are resolved (issue 4.A.2).
#
## If the 1971 rule is used about multi-route convoys (when one of the routes is disrupted, the convoy fails), the Italian convoy order in the Ionian Sea is not part of the convoy, because it is a foreign unit (according to the DPTG). That means that the fleet in the Ionian Sea is not a 'convoying' fleet. In all rulings the support of Naples on the Ionian Sea is cut and the fleet in the Ionian Sea is dislodged by the Turkish fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean.
#
## When the 1982 rule is used about multi-route convoy disruption, then convoys are disrupted when all routes are disrupted (this is the rule I prefer). With this rule, the situation becomes paradoxical. According to the 1971 and 1982 paradox rules, the support given by the fleet in Naples is not cut, that means that the fleet in the Ionian Sea is not dislodged.
#
## According to the 2000 ruling the fleet in the Ionian Sea is not "necessary" and the support of Naples is cut and the fleet in the Ionian Sea is dislodged by the Turkish fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean.
#
## If the Szykman rule, the 'All Hold' rule or DPTG is used, then there is no paradoxical situation. The support of Naples is cut and the fleet in the Ionian Sea is dislodged by the Turkish fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean.
#
## As you can see, the 1982 rules allows the Italian player to save its fleet in the Ionian Sea with a trick. I do not consider this trick as normal tactical play. I prefer the Szykman rule as one of the rules that does not allow this trick. According to this rule the fleet in the Ionian Sea is dislodged.

#    England:
#      A Liverpool - Clyde via Convoy
#      F North Atlantic Ocean Convoys A Liverpool - Clyde
#      F Clyde Supports F North Atlantic Ocean
## In all rulings, except the 1982 paradox ruling, the support of the fleet in Clyde on the North Atlantic Ocean is cut and the French fleet in the Mid-Atlantic Ocean will dislodge the fleet in the North Atlantic Ocean. This is the preferred way.
#
## However, in the 1982 paradox rule (see issue 4.A.2), the support of the fleet in Clyde is not cut. That means that the English fleet in the North Atlantic Ocean is not dislodged.
#
## As you can see, the 1982 rule allows England to save its fleet in the North Atlantic Ocean in a very strange way. Just the support of Clyde is insufficient (if there is no convoy, the support is cut). Only the convoy to the area occupied by own unit, can do the trick in this situation. The embarking of troops in the fleet deceives the enemy so much that it works as a magic cloak. The enemy is not able to dislodge the fleet in the North Atlantic Ocean any more. Of course, this will only work in comedies. I prefer the Szykman rule as one of the rules that does not allow this trick. According to this rule (and all other paradox rules), the fleet in the North Atlantic is just dislodged.

#      F North Sea Convoys A Norway - Belgium
## Without any paradox rule, there are two consistent resolutions. The supports of the English fleet in London and the German fleet in Picardy are not cut. That means that the French fleet in the English Channel and the Russian fleet in the North Sea are dislodged, which makes it impossible to cut the support. The other resolution is that the supports of the English fleet in London the German fleet in Picardy are cut. In that case the French fleet in the English Channel and the Russian fleet in the North Sea will survive and will not be dislodged. This gives the possibility to cut the support.
#
## The 1971 paradox rule and the 2000 rule (see issue 4.A.2) do not have an answer on this.
#
## According to the 1982 rule, the supports are not cut which means that the French fleet in the English Channel and the Russian fleet in the North Sea are dislodged.
#
## The Szykman (which I prefer), has the same result as the 1982 rule. The supports are not cut, the convoying armies fail to move, the fleet in Picardy dislodges the fleet in English Channel and the fleet in Edinburgh dislodges the fleet in the North Sea.
#
## The DPTG rule has in this case the same result as the Szykman rule, because the failing of all convoys is a consistent resolution. So, the armies in Brest and Norway fail to move, while the fleets in Edinburgh and Picardy succeed to move.

## Without any paradox rule, there are two consistent resolutions. In one resolution, the convoy in the English Channel is dislodged by the fleet in the Mid-Atlantic Ocean, while the convoy in the North Sea succeeds. In the other resolution, it is the other way around. The convoy in the North Sea is dislodged by the fleet in Edinburgh, while the convoy in the English Channel succeeds.

#
## The Szykman (which I prefer), has the same result as the 1982 rule. The convoying armies fail to move and the supports are not cut. Because of the failure to cut the support, no fleet succeeds to move.
#
## When the 'All Hold' rule is used, the movement of the armies and the fleets all fail.

## Since there is no consistent resolution where all convoys fail, the DPTG rule has the same result as the 'All Hold' rule. That means the movement of all units fail.

That means that the support of London will not be cut and the fleet in Edinburgh will dislodge the Russian fleet in the North Sea. In this way the support in Belgium is not cut! But if the support in Belgium is not cut, the Russian fleet in the North Sea will not be dislodged and the army in Norway can cut the support in Belgium.

However, the French did not order the convoy. The alternative route with the Russian fleets was unintended. The English fleet in the English Channel (with the convoy order) is not part of this alternative route with the Russian fleets. Since England still "intent" to convoy, the move from Liverpool to Edinburgh should be via convoy and the two armies are swapped. Although, you could argue that this is not really according to the clarification of the 2000 rulebook.

## Since England ordered the army in Norway to move explicitly via convoy and the army in Sweden is moving in opposite direction, only the convoyed route should be considered regardless of the rulebook used. It is clear that the army in Norway will dislodge the Russian army in Sweden. Since the strength of three is in all cases the strongest force.
#
## The army in Sweden will not advance to Norway, because it can not beat the force in the Norwegian Sea. It will be dislodged by the army from Norway.
#
## The more interesting question is whether French fleet in the Norwegian Sea is bounced by the Russian army from Sweden. This depends on the interpretation of issue 4.A.7. If the rulebook is taken literally (choice a), then a dislodged unit can not bounce a unit in the area where the attacker came from. This would mean that the move of the fleet in the Norwegian Sea succeeds However, if choice b is taken (which I prefer), then a bounce is still possible, when there is no head to head battle.

#  generateForces: true
#  state: *STATE_MOVEMENT
#  orders:
## If a unit is attacked by a supported unit, it is not possible to prevent dislodgement by trying to cut the support. But what, if a move is attempted via a convoy?
#
#    Austria:
#      F Adriatic Sea Convoys A Trieste - Venice
#      A Trieste - Venice via Convoy
#
#    Italy:
#      A Venice Supports F Albania - Trieste
#      F Albania - Trieste
## First it should be mentioned that if for issue 4.A.3 choice b or c is taken, then the move from Trieste to Venice is just a move over land, because the army in Venice is not moving in opposite direction. In that case, the support of Venice will not be cut as normal.
#
## In any other choice for issue 4.A.3, it should be decided whether the Austrian attack is considered to be coming from Trieste or from the Adriatic Sea. If it comes from Trieste, the support in Venice is not cut and the army in Trieste is dislodged by the fleet in Albania. If the Austrian attack is considered to be coming from the Adriatic Sea, then the support is cut and the army in Trieste will not be dislodged. See also issue 4.A.4.
#
## First of all, I prefer the 1982/2000 rules for adjacent convoying. This means that I prefer the move from Trieste uses the convoy. Furthermore, I think that the two Italian units are still stronger than the army in Trieste. Therefore, I prefer that the support in Venice is not cut and that the army in Trieste is dislodged by the fleet in Albania.

#      F Skagerrak Convoys A Sweden - Norway
#      F Norwegian Sea Supports A Sweden - Norway
## See decision details 5.B.6. If the 'PREVENT STRENGTH' is incorrectly implemented, due to the fact that it does not take into account that the 'PREVENT STRENGTH' is only zero when the unit is engaged in a head to head battle, then this goes wrong in this test case. The 'PREVENT STRENGTH' of Sweden would be zero, because the opposing unit in Norway successfully moves. Since, this strength would be zero, the fleet in the North Sea would move to Norway. However, although the 'PREVENT STRENGTH' is zero, the army in Sweden would also move to Norway. So, the final result would contain two units that successfully moved to Norway.
#
## Of course, this is incorrect. Norway will indeed successfully move to Sweden while the army in Sweden ends in Norway, because it is stronger then the fleet in the North Sea. This fleet will stay in the North Sea.

#- testCaseID: 6.J.5  # 6.J.5 TEST CASE, CIVIL DISORDER TWO FLEETS WITH DIFFERENT DISTANCE
#  generateForces: true
#  state: *STATE_MOVEMENT
#  orders:
## If two fleets have different distance from the home supply centers, then the fleet with the greatest distance has to be removed. Note that fleets can not go over land.
#
## Russia has to remove one.
## Russia has fleets in Skagerrak and Berlin.
## Russia does not order a disband.
## The distance of the fleet in Berlin is three (the fleet can not go to Warsaw), the fleet in Skaggerrak has distance two (via Norway). So, the fleet in Berlin has to be removed.
#
#- testCaseID: 6.J.6  # 6.J.6. TEST CASE, CIVIL DISORDER TWO FLEETS WITH EQUAL DISTANCE
#  generateForces: true
#  state: *STATE_MOVEMENT
#  orders:
## Alphabetical order is used, when two fleets have equal distance to the home supply centers.
#
## Russia has to remove one.
## Russia has fleets in Berlin and Helgoland Bight.
## Russia does not order a disband.
## The distances of both fleets to one of the home supply centers is three. The fleet in the Berlin is removed, because it appears first in alphabetical order. This also tests whether fleets can not go over land. If they could go over land, the distance of Berlin would be two (going to Warsaw) and the fleet in the Helgoland Bight would have incorrectly be removed.

#- testCaseID: 6.J.7  # 6.J.7. TEST CASE, CIVIL DISORDER TWO FLEETS AND ARMY WITH EQUAL DISTANCE
#  generateForces: true
#  state: *STATE_MOVEMENT
#  orders:
## In removal, the fleet has precedence over an army. In this case there are two fleets, to make the test more complex.
#
## Russia has to remove one.
## Russia has an army in Bohemia, a fleet in Skagerrak and a fleet in the North Sea.
## Russia does not order a disband.
## The distances of the army and the fleets to one of the home supply centers are two. The fleets take precedence above the army (although the army is alphabetical first). The fleet in the North Sea is alphabetical first, compared to Skagerrak and has to be removed.
#
#- testCaseID: 6.J.8  # 6.J.8. TEST CASE, CIVIL DISORDER A FLEET WITH SHORTER DISTANCE THEN THE ARMY
#  generateForces: true
#  state: *STATE_MOVEMENT
#  orders:
## If the fleet has a shorter distance than the army, the army is removed.
#
## Russia has to remove one.
## Russia has an army in Tyrolia and a fleet in the Baltic Sea.
## Russia does not order a disband.
## The distances of the army to Warsaw is three while the distance of the fleet is two. So, the army is removed.
#
#- testCaseID: 6.J.9  # 6.J.9. TEST CASE, CIVIL DISORDER MUST BE COUNTED FROM BOTH COASTS
#  generateForces: true
#  state: *STATE_MOVEMENT
#  orders:
## Distance must be calculated from both coasts.
#
## Russia has to remove one.
## Russia has an army in Tyrolia and a fleet in the Baltic Sea.
## Russia does not order a disband.
## The distance of the fleet to St Petersburg(nc) is three but to St Petersburg(sc) is two. So, the army in Tyrolia must be removed.
#
## Russia has to remove one.
## Russia has an army in Tyrolia and a fleet in Skagerrak.
## Russia does not order a disband.
## The distance of the fleet to St Petersburg(sc) is three but to St Petersburg(nc) is two. So, the army in Tyrolia must be removed.
#
#- testCaseID: 6.J.10  # 6.J.10. TEST CASE, CIVIL DISORDER COUNTING CONVOYING DISTANCE
#  generateForces: true
#  state: *STATE_MOVEMENT
#  orders:
## For armies the distance must be calculated by taking land areas, coastal areas as sea areas.
#
## Italy has to remove one.
## Italy has a fleet in the Ionian Sea and armies in Greece and Silesia.
## Italy does not order a disband.
## The distance from Greece to one of the Italian home supply center is three over land. However, using a convoy the distance is one or two (depending how you count, see issue 4.D.8). Anyway, the army in Silesia has to be removed.
#
#- testCaseID: 6.J.11  # 6.J.11. TEST CASE, CIVIL DISORDER COUNTING DISTANCE WITHOUT CONVOYING FLEET
#  generateForces: true
#  state: *STATE_MOVEMENT
#  orders:
## If there is no convoying fleet the result depends on the interpretation of the rules.
#
## Italy has to remove one.
## Italy has armies in Greece and Silesia.
## Italy does not order a disband.
## The distance from Greece to one of the Italian home supply centers is one, two or three (depending how you count, see issue 4.D.8).
#
## I prefer that sea areas just add one to the distance. According to this preference, the distance is two and the army in Silesia has to be removed.
